The int function is often better to use than eval for converting strings to numbers, as eval cannot
operate on any number with leading zeros.  { } brackets can be used to provide formating instruction
for strings. < > ^ can be used in formating commands to specify justification of the formated input.
Python can open text files with the open command, and those files can be read from or writen into.
Python will, however, delete any files opened with the write command and make a new one in its place.
